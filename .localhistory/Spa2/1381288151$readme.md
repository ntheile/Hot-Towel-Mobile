To Create a PhoneGap Build App
================================
See the docs here, https://build.phonegap.com/docs . To get up and running quickly...simply build the app in release mode then
 run the `BuildScripts\android\android.ps1` and it will output a folder on the desktop.
Zip the folder up and upload it to https://build.phonegap.com . 
An android/iPhone/Blackberry/Windows Phone/etc... app will be built and available for download from the site.
